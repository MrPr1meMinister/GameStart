a) CatalystWars and Flying were both identified as bad GDD's for obvious reasons. For starters, the Game Summary is mixed in with the Mechanics. 
Also there is no explanation of the algorythms in any depth whatsoever. The GDD also is too abbreviated to a point where the player could not 
feel the warmth of completion. Where are the effects, the source, character outlines etc.
Flying is a failed attempt at a GDD for multiple reasons. The controls are simple along with a lackluster storyline which doesn't emasize with the 
player whatsoever. It also looks like an attempt to make a reasonably poor project into something that "flies" off the page, using excessive
bullet points and using different categories to explain the same gaming options.

b) Claw and Doom have both exceeded satusfactory exampled of a GDD. Not only do they create a high level of detail for each category, but the words 
are precise and get to the point. With a large array of characters, traits, elements etc... it also gives the user a distinct idea of what is being
presented in front of them. With the length of the presentation, shows strategy in itself, which can catch an eye or two due to its solid first page,
outlining, and experty executed pitch.

3) The pitch difference is simple, todays pitches focus on the game, where as the OLD game pitches were more focussed on creating glitch-free games
to avoid NDA complications. Also, the budget for gaming these days is much higher. Back with the oldies, a player should be satisfied as long as 
pac-man doesn't eat his old-lady.
